- Daily returns for each ETF

The color scale ranges from blue (negative correlation) through white (no correlation) to red (positive correlation).

## Generation Process

These visualizations are automatically generated by the `azure_stock_lunar_analysis.py` script using:

- matplotlib for creating the base plots
- seaborn for enhancing the visual aesthetics
- pandas for data manipulation

## Usage

These visualizations are referenced in the data engineering report and can be used for presentations or dashboards. They are automatically regenerated each time the analysis script runs, ensuring they reflect the most recent data.
